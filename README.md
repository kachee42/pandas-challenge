# This code analyzes school data for The Py City school district on several different metrics, including, school type, school budget, and school size. These metrics are evaluated against the standardized test scores for reading and math.

# The top 5 schools as evaluated by percent of students passing both math and reading tests with grades of 70 or better are as follows:

# the following table shows the average math grade for students at each school separated by grade. This table shows that there is not a strong correlation between students' scores and their grade, although it does show that scores across grades tend to be very similar at the same schools.

# The follwoing table shows the average reading grade for students at teach school, separated by grade. As the previous table demonstrated, there is not a strong correlation between grade and reading scores, although scores at the same school tend to be similar across all grades.

# The following table shows average scores and percent passing for schools based on their per capita spending. There is a strong correlation between lower spending per student and better scores. This may be due to smaller schools typically having lower per capita budgets, but more research is needed to determine why higher spending does not positively correlate to better scores.

# The following table shows the average scores and percent passing for all schools grouped by school size. Small and medium sized schools perform very similarly, however larger schools perform noticeably worse in all categories.

# The following table shows the average scores and percent passing for all schools grouped by type, charter or district. Charter schools perform noteiceably better than their district school counterparts. Again, this may have more to do with school size than school policies, however more research is needed.
